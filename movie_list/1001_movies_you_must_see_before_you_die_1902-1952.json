This attempt increased in scale and ambition as they pushed it further, resulting in the theatricalisation of life.

It is important to remember that the film does not represent what actually happened during the 1917 Revolution, but is rather an adaptation.",

However he is captured by the British when they try to requisition cattle from the herdsmen at the same time as the commandant meets with a reincarnated Grand Lama. After the trapper is shot, the army discovers an amulet that suggests he is a direct descendant of Genghis Khan. They find him still alive, so the army restores his health and plans to use him as the head of a puppet regime. The trapper is thus thrust into prominence as he is placed in charge of the puppet government. By the end, however, the \"puppet\" turns against his masters in an outburst of fury.",
