But for filmmaker Luis L\u00f3pez Carrasco (1981, Murcia), 1992 was also the year in which the regional parliament building in Cartagena was razed during furious protests against the threatened closure of various local industries.  El a\u00f1o del descubrimiento revives this almost forgotten history in a typical Spanish bar in Cartagena, where different generations come together to drink, eat, smoke and talk. Stories from witnesses, demonstrators and strikers from back then and discussions among younger caf\u00e9 visitors on themes such as class consciousness, the economic crisis and the role of unions percolate to the surface amidst talk of other life issues.",
